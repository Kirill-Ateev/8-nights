# Application for generating the 8 Nights collection.

https://getgems.io/nights

The collection was released on December 27, 2023 on the TON network in NFT format with data in IPFS. In it, I tried to go beyond the current standards of what can be called art. Inspired by Warhol, his take on video, especially the works of "Sleep" and "Empire" and the Russian abstractionists. I wanted to utilize this form and bring something new, especially now that multimedia can be an art object more than ever through blockchain. That's how the idea for 8 Nights was born. It is an exploration in generative compression-based multimedia art, the first of its kind. Each work is unique and consists of sounds and generative properties that build up into a recognizable melody. Based on the bit information of the sound, a pixel abstraction is formed, which is a visual representation of that data. The picture and sound are then glued together using a specially selected video codec and compression.

Files stored on IPFS via CAR format. The original components are presented in the repository.
